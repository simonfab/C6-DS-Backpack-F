# Hi good evening. 
# Please check the following code. 
# I am trying to solve a logic problem 
# (which was asked under logic section in the selection test of this boot camp) through coding. 
# As far as I can remember the problem was something like “a group of kids have a certain number of marbles to play. 
# Each time they play a game they loose certain number of marbles and they hide the rest of the marbles under a tree. 
# A squirrel comes and steels some marbles till the number of marbles are higher than 12. 
# Also, the kids can only play the game if the total number of marbles are greater than or equal to 11. 
# How many games they can play. 
# I remember that the start number of marble in this game was such that before the last game the number 
# of marbles left was 11 so the squirrel cannot steel any, but they can still play 1 last game. 
"""

    if marbles >= 12:
        marbles -= theft

print(f"Number of games: {game}")
"""
# Question 1) is the code correct?
# Question 2) Why does it only print to maximum of 5 times doesn’t matter if you increase the marbles to 70 or 80.
# Question 3) what is the best way to print the number of games they can play in this case rather than 
# printing the word “game” for the number of times they can play.
